# Getting started with your Raspberry Pi 3

You will find the best tutorials to learn physical computing with Python on the official website of the Raspberry Pi foundation. Just follow the links below to access our selection of tutorials that you can do with you Make & Play starter kit:

* [Raspberry Pi Quick start Guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/quick-start-guide/quickstart/): Check you have the equipment you need and log in to your Raspberry Pi for the first time.
* [Learning Physical computing with Python](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/physical-computing-with-python/)
  * [Getting started](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/physical-computing-with-python/worksheet/)
  * [Using an active buzzer](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/physical-computing-with-python/buzzer/)
  * [Making traffic lights](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/physical-computing-with-python/trafficlights/)
  * [Using a light-dependent resistor](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/physical-computing-with-python/ldr/)
  * [Using an ultrasonic distance sensor HC-SR04](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/physical-computing-with-python/distance/)
  * [Using a PIR motion sensor](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/physical-computing-with-python/pir/)

By the end of this course, you should be able to imagine and realise your own projects like :

* Use an LDR and an LED to create an automated night light.
* Use a PIR sensor to trigger video capture from a camera.

Have fun!
